This Shopping Cart app is a React project I completed as part of the Odin Project curriculum. The app functions as a mock shop with three pages: a home page, product catalog, and shopping cart. The project instructions can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart#project-solution

This project allowed me to continue practicing some previously learned concepts such as React hooks, API integration, and responsive web design (media queries), while also giving me an opportunity to put newer concepts to use such as routing, lifting state, props validation, and CSS Modules.

I really enjoy projects like this where I get to flex my creativity in a relatable scenario while reinforcing many of the concepts I've learned so far throughout my coding journey.
